          Evder is a website developed <b class ="interactBold"> individually </b> by me, for a class project. <br>
                          It was built using <b class ="interactBold"> html, </b> <b class ="interactBold"> css, </b> <b class ="interactBold"> php, </b> <b class ="interactBold"> ajax</b> and <b class ="interactBold"> mysql</b>. </p>

        <p class="bio"> Evder was developed as an attempt to solve a problem. For the project, we were
        required to only fulfill a set of technical requirements, the topic and content of our websites were left up to us. I wanted
      to come up with an attempt to <b class ="interactBold"> challenge Vancouver's image as a city without much excitement to it.</b> <br><br> From this came the
    idea of Evder: a website that collects all of the events that are happening in a city of your choice and displays them to you
  in one location. Users are able to sort the type of event they would like to go to by the city, type of event and price of the event. </p>

        <i class = "noteDesc">  This was my first time working with backend development and so developing my database design was an iterative process.
          Originally, I believed my database would be quite small, after all, I only needed to manage events and users. But as I began coding, I began
          to notice the need to add more and more tables to my database. Upon completion, I had five: <b class ="interactBold"> events, </b>  <b class ="interactBold"> personalization,
          </b><b class ="interactBold"> posts, </b> <b class ="interactBold"> savedposts, </b> and <b class ="interactBold"> users.</b>

        <p class = "bio">
          One of my most memorable challenges was when I was attempting to implement the ability for users to save events.
          I was attemping to save <b class = "interactBold"> multiple userid's for a single event, </b> in the events table. This was
          because I wanted to keep track of which events were saved to the accounts of which users. <br> <br>
          It was not until later, when saying aloud my problem, that
          I realized that I was going about it all wrong.
          This lead to the creation of a new table in my database which stores the username of
          the user, along with the event id, to be able to access that event later. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="eight columns">
        <h2 class="aboutme"> Reflection </h2>
        <p class="bio">
          If I were to do this again, I spend more time working on the design of my website
          as, at the time, I did not have enough time to work on the frontend side of the things.
          I would have also liked to have run some user tests, as well as developed a way
          automatically fetch event data from the web.
          <br> <br>
          As the site is now, I’m proud that I managed to get all of the functionalities required to
          work as it took me a while to learn how to do so.
          Overall, I think I ended up learning a lot by struggling through various problems
          and figuring out how to solve them. Some parts definitely required me to step back and reexamine the issue
          in order to solve the problem and I feel that this made me more capable of handling such problems in the future.
