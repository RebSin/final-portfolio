        <p class="bio"> Muted is a <b class ="interactBold">  static clothing company website </b> developed for a class project. While we were given
          requirements, such as <b class ="interactBold">  only using HTML and CSS, </b> to fufill, the type of site we created and how we fulfilled those requirements was left up to us.
          Both Adrian and I had interest in working on a site that sells high quality clothing and so came forth Muted.
          Users of this site are able to interact with the site as though they are genuinely able to purchase items, though
          <b class ="interactBold"> we used placeholders. </b> </p>

          Before beginning a project, especially one that is large scale, it is typical to create <b class ="interactBold">  mockups  </b> and <b class ="interactBold">  wireframes. </b>
          However, this time we were only allowed to use the code we had written, and our styleguides we had worked on before.
          This is the first time I had worked on creating a styleguide and using it made the workload much lighter. However,
          even with the style guide, the <b class ="interactBold">  most important part </b> of this project was <b class ="interactBold"> speaking with our peers, </b>
          who revealed to us problems we might have missed, such as placement or responsiveness issues.

<!-- Project Challenges + Reflection -->

        <h2 class = "aboutme"> Challenges </h2>
        <p class = "bio">
          The biggest challenge of this project was learning to rely on not using
          wireframes or other prototypes to help with the development. The creation of the style guide
          was particularly challenging as we were unable to see how particular pieces would look together
          beforehand. However, I think working on this site in this way made me a better designer, as
          I began to think about styling in a different way and was able to complete this assignment,
          alongside my partner, in a visually appealing way.

      </div>
      <div class="eight columns">
        <h2 class="aboutme"> Reflection </h2>
        <p class="bio">
          If I were to work on this project again, I likely would invest more time into the copywriting
          as well as putting more time into ensuring the site was properly responsive, as I am able to
          identify some issues with the responsiveness now. Additionally, I would have liked to make the
          website more realistic with fewer placeholders if possible, but I believe that even with
          the placeholders, the site is visually appealing and the interactions are clear.
          <br> <br>
          Overall, this project was very fun to work on. I especially enjoyed gaining feedback from our
          peers and our TA and incorporating those feedbacks into our work, which I feel
          made it an overall much stronger project.
